# Handwriting Synthesis
Implementation of the handwriting synthesis experiments in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850">Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks</a> by Alex Graves.  The implementation closely follows the original paper, with a few slight deviations, and the generated samples are of similar quality to those presented in the paper.
